    			<h2>Installing Cinnamon Desktop for Ubuntu 12.04</h2>
    			<p>Published by <em>John Keenan</em></p>
  			</header>
  				<p>
  				If you use Ubuntu 12.04 and just happen to not like Unity all too much or just feel like having another desktop environment instead, this tutorial is for you!

So first off, we’re going to be installing the latest version of the Cinnamon desktop, which looks fairly similar to the cinnamon desktop Linux Mint 14 uses. There are some slight differences in design, but it all functions the same. I would also like to mention, I’ll be adding some screenshots below and that I’ll be running Ubuntu 12.04 w/ Cinnamon via VirtualBox.

So first we need to open up the Terminal (you can search for it in the Dash Home)

In the terminal, you’ll want to add this line:

sudo add-apt-repository ppa:gwendal-lebihan-dev/cinnamon-stable

What the above is basically going to do is add a repository that has a stable Cinnamon desktop version and give us access to it. However, these repositories usually have lists of different versions, so we need to make sure we’re up to date with our updates to select the most recent stable version of the desktop environment, so we’re just going to update our system first before we do any installing.

In the terminal, you’ll want to add this line:

sudo apt-get update

Depending how long it’s been since you last updated, this can either be very quick or long.

Now it’s time to install the actual software now that we have an updated system and access to the working Cinnamon repository.

In the terminal, you’ll want to add this line:

sudo apt-get install cinnamon

It may ask you Yes or No, you’ll type either Yes or Y, depending on the question, and also may need to type in your password, but after that’s finished, you log out and during the login screen, you’ll see a little Ubuntu logo next to your username. You’ll have to click that to see a menu of different desktop environments to choose.

Desktop Chooser

My menu may be longer than yours, but you’ll want to choose Cinnamon 2D and login.
